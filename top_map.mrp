NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator Mmux_PWR_14_o_PWR_14_o_mux_649_OUT311
   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer Mmux_n20926101_f5.  There is more than
   one F5MUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network inst_i2c_mem/doutb<7> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 7 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   inst_i2c_mem/doutb<6>,
   inst_i2c_mem/doutb<5>,
   inst_i2c_mem/doutb<4>,
   inst_i2c_mem/doutb<3>,
   inst_i2c_mem/doutb<2>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal i_clock are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:MapLib:797 - Your design is targeting LX/SX Production Step 0/1/ES devices.
   Please note that there are new specifications for the DCMs to guarantee
   maximum frequency performance. If the DCM input clock might stop or if the
   DCM reset might be asserted for an extended time, then use of the dcm_standby
   macro may be required. Please see Answer Record 21127.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   4 block(s) optimized away
   8 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<7>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<6>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<5>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<4>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<3>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<2>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<1>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "inst_i2c_mem/doutb<0>" is sourceless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
GND 		inst_i2c_mem/XST_GND
VCC 		inst_i2c_mem/XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
