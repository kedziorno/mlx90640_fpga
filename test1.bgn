This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (1). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.
