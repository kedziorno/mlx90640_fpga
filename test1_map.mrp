--------------------
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator inst_float2fixed/blk00000302 failed to
   merge with F5 multiplexer inst_float2fixed/blk000003fd.  There is more than
   one F5MUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network
   inst_float2fixed/U0/op_inst/FLT_PT_OP/FLT_TO_FIX_OP.SPD.OP/RESULT<63> has no
   load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 65 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   inst_float2fixed/U0/op_inst/FLT_PT_OP/FLT_TO_FIX_OP.SPD.OP/RESULT<62>,

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal i_clock are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:MapLib:797 - Your design is targeting LX/SX Production Step 0/1/ES devices.
   Please note that there are new specifications for the DCMs to guarantee
   maximum frequency performance. If the DCM input clock might stop or if the
   DCM reset might be asserted for an extended time, then use of the dcm_standby
   macro may be required. Please see Answer Record 21127.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 32 IOs, 20 are locked
   and 12 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 343 block(s) removed
  60 block(s) optimized away
 258 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
