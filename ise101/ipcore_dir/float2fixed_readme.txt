   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

float2fixed.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

float2fixed_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

float2fixed_floating_point_v4_0_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

float2fixed_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

float2fixed_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
