11.2.2. Temperature calculation

After the parameters restore the temperature calculation is done using following
calculation flow (assuming that the EEPROM data are already extracted):

Supply voltage value calculation (common for all pixels) - 11.2.2.2 *


Ambient temperature calculation (common for all pixels) - 11.2.2.3 *


Gain compensation - 11.2.2.5.1 *


IR data compensation â€“ offset, VDD and Ta - 11.2.2.5.3 *


IR data Emissivity compensation - 11.2.2.5.4


IR data gradient compensation - 11.2.2.7 *


Normalizing to sensitivity - 11.2.2.8 *


Calculating To - 11.2.2.9

Figure 16 To calculation flow

For this example we calculate the temperature of pixel (12, 16) i.e. row=12 and the column=16.
Values marked with green are extracted from device EEPROM
Values marked with grey are final parameter values or are values to be used for next calculations
