Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       6,579 out of  30,720   21%
    Number used as Flip Flops:        6,381
    Number used as Latches:             198
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            12,230 out of  30,720   39%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          8,348 out of  15,360   54%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   8,348 out of   8,348 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   8,348   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      12,348 out of  30,720   40%
    Number used as logic:            12,230
    Number used as a route-thru:        118

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                237 out of     448   52%
    IOB Latches:                         35
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               7 out of      32   21%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 7
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:              37 out of     192   19%
