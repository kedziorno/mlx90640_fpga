The following files were generated for 'fixed2float' in directory 
./:

fixed2float.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

fixed2float.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

fixed2float.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

fixed2float.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

fixed2float_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

fixed2float_floating_point_v3_0_xst_1.ndf:
   Optional output file produced for cores that generate NGC files.
   The NDF files allow third party synthesis tools to infer resource
   utilization and timing from the NGC files associated with these new
   cores.

fixed2float_floating_point_v3_0_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

fixed2float_for.v:
   Unisim Verilog file containing the information required to support formal
   verification of the module.

fixed2float_ngdbuild.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

fixed2float_padded.edn:
   EDIF wrapper file generated for a core when the Generate netlist
   wrapper with IO pads project option is enabled. The file adds input
   pads and output pads to the core, allowing you to process the
   generated core through the Xilinx design flow as if it were a
   complete chip design.

fixed2float_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

fixed2float_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
