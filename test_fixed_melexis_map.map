Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         9,038 out of  30,720   29%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            14,190 out of  30,720   46%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          9,904 out of  15,360   64%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   9,904 out of   9,904 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   9,904   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      14,368 out of  30,720   46%
    Number used as logic:            13,947
    Number used as a route-thru:        178
    Number used as Shift registers:     243

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 67 out of     448   14%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 1
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:              37 out of     192   19%
    Number used as RAMB16s:              37

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.35

Peak Memory Usage:  1059 MB
