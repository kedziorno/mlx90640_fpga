Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:        11,328 out of  20,480   55%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            14,801 out of  20,480   72%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          8,556 out of  10,240   83%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   8,556 out of   8,556 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   8,556   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      15,065 out of  20,480   73%
