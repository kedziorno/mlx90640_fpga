Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         9,754 out of  30,720   31%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            15,527 out of  30,720   50%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:         10,269 out of  15,360   66%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:  10,269 out of  10,269 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of  10,269   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      15,800 out of  30,720   51%
