Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         9,830 out of  30,720   31%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            14,989 out of  30,720   48%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          9,946 out of  15,360   64%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   9,946 out of   9,946 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   9,946   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      15,209 out of  30,720   49%
