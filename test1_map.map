Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         9,203 out of  17,344   53%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            14,406 out of  17,344   83%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          8,080 out of   8,672   93%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   8,080 out of   8,080 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   8,080   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      14,663 out of  17,344   84%
    Number used as logic:            14,160
    Number used as a route-thru:        257
    Number used as Shift registers:     246

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     250   12%
  Number of RAMB16s:                     22 out of      28   78%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.43

Peak Memory Usage:  925 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 mins 58 secs
