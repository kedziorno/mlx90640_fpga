Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         9,341 out of  30,720   30%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            14,507 out of  30,720   47%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          9,835 out of  15,360   64%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   9,835 out of   9,835 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   9,835   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      14,746 out of  30,720   48%
