Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:        12,066 out of  30,720   39%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            16,752 out of  30,720   54%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:         11,804 out of  15,360   76%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:  11,804 out of  11,804 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of  11,804   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      17,073 out of  30,720   55%
    Number used as logic:            16,502
    Number used as a route-thru:        321
    Number used as Shift registers:     250

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
