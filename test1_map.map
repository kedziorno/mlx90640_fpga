Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:        11,744 out of  30,720   38%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            16,356 out of  30,720   53%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:         11,481 out of  15,360   74%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:  11,481 out of  11,481 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of  11,481   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      16,699 out of  30,720   54%
    Number used as logic:            16,113
    Number used as a route-thru:        343
    Number used as Shift registers:     243

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     448    7%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 3
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:              39 out of     192   20%
    Number used as RAMB16s:              39

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.43
