WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator inst_float2fixed/blk00000302 failed to
   merge with F5 multiplexer inst_float2fixed/blk000003fd.  There is more than
   one F5MUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:        12,079 out of  30,720   39%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            16,691 out of  30,720   54%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:         11,932 out of  15,360   77%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:  11,932 out of  11,932 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of  11,932   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      16,980 out of  30,720   55%
    Number used as logic:            16,441
    Number used as a route-thru:        289
    Number used as Shift registers:     250

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     448    7%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 2
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:              41 out of     192   21%
    Number used as RAMB16s:              41

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.42
