Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           511 out of  30,720    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               704 out of  30,720    2%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            433 out of  15,360    2%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     433 out of     433 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     433   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         742 out of  30,720    2%
    Number used as logic:               697
    Number used as a route-thru:         38
    Number used as Shift registers:       7

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     448    7%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 3
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:               4 out of     192    2%
    Number used as RAMB16s:               4

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.61

Peak Memory Usage:  822 MB
