WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator inst_float2fixed/blk00000302 failed to
   merge with F5 multiplexer inst_float2fixed/blk000003fd.  There is more than
   one F5MUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

  Number of 4 input LUTs:            15,072 out of  30,720   49%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:         10,012 out of  15,360   65%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:  10,012 out of  10,012 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of  10,012   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      15,263 out of  30,720   49%
    Number used as logic:            14,824
    Number used as a route-thru:        191
    Number used as Shift registers:     248

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     448    7%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 2
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:              23 out of     192   11%
    Number used as RAMB16s:              23

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.48

Peak Memory Usage:  809 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  22 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   21 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
