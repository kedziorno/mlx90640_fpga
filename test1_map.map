Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           107 out of  30,720    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               210 out of  30,720    1%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            175 out of  15,360    1%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     175 out of     175 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     175   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         228 out of  30,720    1%
    Number used as logic:               210
    Number used as a route-thru:         18

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                 32 out of     448    7%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                 3
  Number of FIFO16/RAMB16s:               2 out of     192    1%
    Number used as RAMB16s:               2
