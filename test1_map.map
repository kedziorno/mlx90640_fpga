Number of warnings:    4
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:        12,267 out of  20,480   59%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:            16,111 out of  20,480   78%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          9,600 out of  10,240   93%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   9,600 out of   9,600 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   9,600   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:      16,381 out of  20,480   79%
