   "test1" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc4vsx35, package ff668, speed -10
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for this device (1). Unless your design is
targeted at devices of this stepping level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any available performance and functional
enhancements for this device. The latest stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
